Lesson 2 

Area | Price
--- | ---
1400 sqft | 112,000 
1800 sqft | 144,000 

Given price per unit is constant what is cost of 1500?

Helpful mental math approach:

`112,000 + 1/4(112,000 + 144,000) = 120,000` <-- this eq I have never done w/ logic

You can say 1400 is priced at 112,000 plus a quarter of the way to 1800's price which is 144,000. 

Of course, I think alt way is much better w/c is determining avg price per sqft then mult by unit. 

1500 * 80 = 120,000. <-- this I knew
