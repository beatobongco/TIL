# Lesson 11: Programming Bayes Rule

## Problem 

p(c) = p0 # Chance of having cancer
p(Pos|C) = p1 # Chance of having cancer if test result is positive
p(Neg|Not C) = p2 # Chance of not having cancer if test result is negative

1. Using f() find the chance of having cancer given the test was positive.
2. Using g() find the chance of having cancer given the test was negative.

## Solution
```
# possibility of having cancer if test is positive
def f(p0,p1,p2):
  return p0*p1 / (p0*p1 + (1-p0) * (1-p2))

print f(.1,.9,.8)
print f(.01,.7,.9)

# possibility of having cancer if test is negative
def g(p0,p1,p2):
  return p0*(1-p1) / (p0*(1-p1) + (1-p0)*p2)

print g(.1,.9,.8)
print g(.01,.7,.9)
```
Note: To get what's asked for try to make the formula match the value you'll be getting by using `1-variable` to get the reverse.
