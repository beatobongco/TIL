## Lesson 15: Variance

Given a set of elements x = [3,4,5,6,7]

Obtain mean, variance and standard deviation.

```
import math

data = [3,4,5,6,7]
mean = 0 # divide sum of all by number of elements
variance = 0 # sum(element-mean) squared / number of elements
std_dev = 0 # sqrt of variance

# Get mean
mean = sum(data) / len(data)
variance = sum((x-mean)**2 for x in data)/len(data)
std_dev = math.sqrt(variance)

print mean, variance, std_dev
```

OUTPUT: 5,2,1.414

### standard score

standard_score = element - mean / std_deviation

ex. std score of 3?

3-5 / 1.414
std_score = -2.12

## Lesson 29: Regression

Remember the linear equation
`y = bx + a`
PICK ANY POINT ON THE LINE to solve for the linear equation
Remember to get a, just get y where x = 0
And to get b just do rise over run meaning a / picked point's x

If b (slope) is neg, line goes down
You'll know if a is pos or neg by seeing what the value of y is if x=0

So gist is: What is best fitting line for a collection of points? Here's how to get b

```
x = [6,2,1,-1]
y = [7,3,2,0]

x_bar = sum(x) / len(x)
y_bar = sum(y) / len(y)

b = sum((_x - x_bar) * (_y - y_bar) for _x,_y in zip(x,y)) / sum((_x - x_bar) ** 2 for _x in x)

print b
```

## Lesson 30: Correlation

A value between -1 and 1, how related two vars are 

-1 perfectly linear going down
0 looks like a straight horizontal line
+1 perfectly linear going up 

```
import math

x = [3,4,5]
y = [7,8,9]

bar_x = sum(x) / len(x)
bar_y = sum(y) / len(y)

top = sum((i-bar_x) * (j-bar_y) for i,j in zip(x, y))
bottom = sum((i-bar_x)**2 for i in x) * sum((j-bar_y)**2 for j in y)

print top/math.sqrt(bottom)
```

## Monty Hall Problem

```
from random import randint

N = 100000

def simulate(N):
    K = 0
    for x in range(0, N):
      ###insert your code here###
      choice = randint(1,3) # my choice
      car = randint(1,3) # car is in
      monty = set([1,2,3]) - set([choice, car])
      
      # pick other door
      choice = set([1,2,3]) - set([choice, monty.pop()])

      # win
      if choice.pop() == car:
          K = K + 1
        
    return float(K) / float(N)

print simulate(N)
```
