## Lesson 15: Variance

Given a set of elements x = [3,4,5,6,7]

Obtain mean, variance and standard deviation.

```
import math

data = [3,4,5,6,7]
mean = 0 # divide sum of all by number of elements
variance = 0 # sum(element-mean) squared / number of elements
std_dev = 0 # sqrt of variance

# Get mean
mean = sum(data) / len(data)
variance = sum((x-mean)**2 for x in data)/len(data)
std_dev = math.sqrt(variance)

print mean, variance, std_dev
```

OUTPUT: 5,2,1.414

### standard score

standard_score = element - mean / std_deviation

ex. std score of 3?

3-5 / 1.414
std_score = -2.12
