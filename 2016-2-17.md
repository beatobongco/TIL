## Lesson 15: Variance

Given a set of elements x = [3,4,5,6,7]

Obtain mean, variance and standard deviation.

```
import math

data = [15,20,25,30,35]
mean = 0 # divide sum of all by number of elements
variance = 0 # sum(element-mean) squared / number of elements
std_dev = 0 # sqrt of variance

# Get mean
mean = sum(data) / len(data)

t = []

for x in data:
  t.append((mean - x)**2)

variance = sum(t)/len(t)
std_dev = math.sqrt(variance)

print mean, variance, std_dev

```
OUTPUT: 5,2,1.414
