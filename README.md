# TIL
A small list of shit I learned. For stuff learned about ML/AI check out my [X Days of ML Code](https://github.com/beatobongco/X_Days_of_ML_Code).

Some of my talks and presentations can be found [here](https://beatobongco.com/TIL/presentations/).

I love to read. Here are some [book recommendations](https://beatobongco.com/book-highlights/) and my [reading list](https://github.com/beatobongco/ReadingList).

## 2/4/2019
* 5kb data binding for the DOM https://simulacra.js.org/
* Watch object changes in JS. Idea: make a tiny lib where you define an object, a template string, and an element and the contents of the element will change if any property on the object changes https://davidwalsh.name/watch-object-changes

## 1/31/2019
* Slides in Markdown + React (JSX) https://github.com/jxnblk/mdx-deck

## 1/29/2019
* Very good post describing hard problems in UI engineering https://overreacted.io/the-elements-of-ui-engineering/
* Emotions are part and parcel of our cognition. This article + Voss' Never Split the Difference show that empathy, connection, engaging with the emotional system are way better than cold logic. Model: emotion as the sugar that helps the medicine go down, chemical reactions that help oil the delivery system of information into the brain. https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/opinion/learning-emotion-education.html
* Rationality as thinking in service of goals. If IQ is the horsepower of the motor, rationality is the efficiency of the output. https://commoncog.com/blog/putting-mental-models-to-practice-part-2-introduction-to-rationality/

## 12/11/2018

## 8/12/2018
* Interesting take on augmented intelligence. I don't agree with all but I agree with quite a few. https://www.wired.com/2008/04/ff-wozniak/
* Major points of agreement: (1) memorization is needed no matter the field. Faster retrieval = can try more combinations of things or think at a higher-level with solid foundations. (2) Sleep (3) Deep work (non-interruption)  
* Major points of disagreement: (1) discouting collaboration through socialization. It's superadditive and also most opportunities in life come from weak ties. (2) becoming proficient in better tools amplify our brain power more than optimizing the biological brain. (3) A lot of change in this world has come people who could influence others, through writing or through leading.

## 7/12/2018
* You can use pre-trained CNNs by using their pre-softmax output (perhaps an FC layer or whatever) as features for your network. This is called **fixed feature extraction**
* You can also the pretrained model's weights and use as starting point, modifying the architecture. This is called **fine tuning**.

* Abstract S01E04: Bjarke Ingels. He wanted to become a graphic novelist and studied architecture to learn to draw. He became world renowned architect specializing in "pragmatic utopian" architecture. Later on he published a graphic novel illustrating his ideas. Take signals from your youth and use it to augment your present.

* Ideas: create code tools that make CRUD easy, like Positron idea but more general. Can dogfood it at Insync or Incorgito.

## 12/11/2017
* Abstract S01E02: Tinker Hatfield. When he discusses his design process, he says he draws randomly on a notebook. Ref: stochastic tinkering and an "explorative" meditation I recall from Headspace (just let thoughts flow for a time then when you're finished write down what valuable insights you got).
* > "I think if you just stay in your studio and try and dream up new ideas there's not a good foundation for your idea. Just get out there and experience life. That just gives you a library in your head to then translate that into unique new design work." - Tinker Hatfield

* It is possbile to "overfit" life from the experiences/data you've had so far. It's important to adopt a strategy that generalizes well. Have a general direction but make sure your model can take advantage and learn properly from data that is yet to come. 
* Aside from my own book highlights and notes, this is a good Antifragile reference https://startupbros.com/antifragile-act-cant-know-much/ 

## 11/11/2017
* One interpretation of the recent success of neural networks is that humans should encode as little knowledge as possible into AI software, and instead make them figure things out for themselves from scratch. https://www.wired.com/story/googles-ai-wizard-unveils-a-new-twist-on-neural-networks/

* Complete [Interaction Design Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/interaction-design) by UC San Diego 

## 10/9/2017
* JS doesn't have class inheritance (no copying is done), it has "delegation" links through the 
`[[Prototype]]` chain. When attempting a property access on an object that doesn't have that property, 
it will look through the prototype chain (you can view this by doing`Object.getPrototypeOf(yourObject)` or `yourObject.__proto__`. Second one works on most browsers but not all). - YDKJS

## 10/2/2017
* In general, faking classes (even as mixins) in JS often sets more landmines for future coding than solving present real problems. - YDKJS

## 9/15/2017
* “Scientists generally agree that no theory is 100 percent correct. Thus, the real test of knowledge is not truth, but utility.” - Noah Harari
* You have to build out your toolbox. Thus, the secret to great thinking is to learn and employ a variety of mental models.
* World-class thinkers are often silo-free thinkers. They avoid looking at life through the lens of one subject. Instead, they develop “liquid knowledge” that flows easily from one topic to the next.

* Function programming http://www.lihaoyi.com/post/WhatsFunctionalProgrammingAllAbout.html
* Having a macro view is essential. Don't miss the forest for the trees, but do understand the intricacies of the trees so you can better navigate the forest.
* js `this` is not an author-time binding but a runtime binding. It is contextual based on the conditions of the function's invocation. `this` binding has nothing to do with where a function is declared, but has instead everything to do with the manner in which the function is called.
* `this` is neither a reference to the function itself, nor is it a reference to the function's lexical scope.

* `Revealing Module` pattern in JS is like a public API for a module. https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/scope%20%26%20closures/ch5.md
* `Closures` (in my own words, not necessarily accurate) are just that functions retain memory/reference (?) of variables defined at the same scope level. 
* Defined in the book: Closure is when a function can remember and access its lexical scope even when it's invoked outside its lexical scope.
* A useful memory aid for this is:

```js
function Monster(name) {
  var life = 100;

  function takeDamage(n) {
    life -= n
  }

  function showHP() {
    console.log(name + ' has ' + life + ' HP.')
  }

  return {
    takeDamage: takeDamage,
    showHP: showHP
  }
}

var bakemono = Monster('Poring')
var bakemono2 = Monster('Poporing')

bakemono.takeDamage(10)
bakemono.showHP() // Poring has 90 HP.

// note that bakemono2 is not affected
bakemono2.showHP() // Poporing has 100 HP.
```

## 8/22/2017
* Writing stuff out may be important for learning because our hands command one of the largest provisions of our brains based on the [cortical homonculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortical_homunculus). Notice hands are allocated greater resources than both the eyes and ears.
* YDKJS book 2, chapter 3: Use immediately invoked function expressions (IIFE's) to keep your global scope clean. `(function a() { console.log(1) })()`

## 11/29/2016
 * TIL: When using redis from a docker image (or redis in general actually) remember to do the following on the host server...

   - set the Linux kernel overcommit memory setting to 1 by `sysctl vm.overcommit_memory=1` and adding `vm.overcommit_memory = 1` to `/etc/sysctl.conf`. The default is 0. Redis background save may fail under low memory condition. (This is what I assume the original problem was about)
   - Increase max connections so a TCP setting can be enforced. Set `sysctl net.core.somaxconn=65535` and add ti `sysctl.conf`
   - Disable Transparent Huge Pages (THP). If enabled (by default) this will create latency and memory usage issues with Redis. Run `echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled`.

 * `flex: none;` This is equivalent to flex: 0 0 auto. It sizes the item according to its width/height properties, but makes it fully inflexible. This is similar to flex: initial except it is not allowed to shrink, even in an overflow situation. Super useful for divs with no content and background image. https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/f/flex/#article-header-id-4
 * TODO: Make a tutorial for flex. Remember: `display: flex;`, `flex: 1`, `overflow: auto or hidden;` are your 3 key css properties to modify to get awesome scaling apps.

 * You can ssh into a docker machine like so: `docker-machine ssh radar`
 * using `scp`: Copy the file "foobar.txt" from a remote host to the local host `$ scp your_username@remotehost.edu:foobar.txt /some/local/directory` Copy the file "foobar.txt" from the local host to a remote host `$ scp foobar.txt your_username@remotehost.edu:/some/remote/directory`
 * using `scp` in `docker-machine` `scp -i ~/.docker/machine/machines/radar/id_rsa dump.sql.gz root@$(docker-machine ip radar):~` Explanation: copy a file from your docker machine without logging on to said machine using ssh keys. `scp -i <identity file/rsa id path> <from file path host:filepath> <to file path host:filepath>`

 * `docker-compose up --no-deps <container name>` - Using docker, if you have images of a database don't keep on using `docker-compose up db`. It might cause weird shit to happen to your database. Instead for example, if you have images: web and db do `docker-compose up --no-deps web` to put web up but not disturb your db.

 * Aliases - aliases are a cool way to make your life easier. Edit ~/.bashrc with your favorite text editor and make shorcuts like `alias dcp='docker-compose'` to type in `dcp` instead of `docker-compose`

 * Restoring a dockerized database from a local .sql file
   * `cd` to where your .sql file is located

   * Go to path where sql file is and `gunzip`
   * Finally `psql -hdb -U <username> -W < backup.sql`

 * Run a docker container `docker-compose run --rm <container> <cmd>`
