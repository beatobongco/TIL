## Probability distributions

In continuous distributions, every outcome has probability 0. 

e.g. spin bottle, how much percent to get exactly 180 deg? 0 because there's infinite number of possibilities let's say 179.9312415123123125

## Correlation vs Causation

Confounding variable - var that makes things not correlated

## Problem set
