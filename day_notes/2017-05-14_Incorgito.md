Peter Thiel says that every company can be plotted on a linear spectrum and that consultancies are nihilistic.

Let's shatter the conception. Let's be consultants who care. Let's be consulting craftsmen.

## Responsbilities 

>The best thing I did as a manager at PayPal was to make every person in the company responsible for doing just one thing. Every employeeâ€™s one thing was unique, and everyone knew I would evaluate him only on that one thing. I had started doing this just to simplify the task of managing people. But then I noticed a deeper result: defining roles reduced conflict. Most fights inside a company happen when colleagues compete for the same responsibilities. Startups face an especially high risk of this since job roles are fluid at the early stages. Eliminating competition makes it easier for everyone to build the kinds of long- term relationships that transcend mere professionalism. More than that, internal peace is what enables a startup to survive at all. When a startup fails, we often imagine it succumbing to predatory rivals in a competitive ecosystem. But every company is also its own ecosystem, and factional strife makes it vulnerable to outside threats. Internal conflict is like an autoimmune disease: the technical cause of death may be pneumonia, but the real cause remains hidden from plain view. - Peter Thiel, Zero to One

Responsible for one thing doesn't mean that each Incorgi must do just one thing. An Incorgi can (and should) do many things but ultimately answer for and own **one thing**.

### Steve

The one thing: technical skill. 

* Technical leader.
* Chooses what technology to use based on requirements. 
* Responsible for high level architecture and systems design. 
* Delegates work to other programmers.
* Develops/recommends tools, libraries, and techniques to speed up development process.
* Makes all final technical decisions.

### Ria

The one thing: functional skill.

* Functional leader. Leads everything related to operations.
* First-in-line support.
* Business analyst responsible for leading efforts to empathize with client and define the problem.
* Project manager that keeps everything ticking and on time. Makes sure we never miss milestones.

> Sharp milestones are in fact a service to the team, and one they can properly expect from a manager. The fuzzy milestone is the harder burden to live with. It is in fact a millstone that grinds down morale, for it deceives one about lost time until it is irremediable. And chronic schedule slippage is a morale-killer. - Fred Brooks, The Mythical Man Month

* Handles client relations.
* Plans and Control lead.

> The investment of a modest amount of skilled effort in a Plans and Controls function is very rewarding. It makes far more difference in project accomplishment than if these people worked directly on building the product programs. For the Plans and Controls group is the watchdog who renders the imperceptible delays visible and who points up the critical elements. It is the early warning system against losing a year, one day at a time. - Frederick Brooks, The Mythical Man Month 

* Makes all final decisions on client business rules and movement of schedules.

### Beato

The one thing: business development.

* Business development lead.
* Frontend design and development.

Have to muddy the rule a bit here since I must code and we're shorthanded.

* Researches ways to make team better/more efficient and maximize profit and value to customers while minimizing tean work time (efficiency).
* High level client relations.
* Makes final decisions on pricing and business development.
