# 3 Processes
## That Are Mandatory for Interns

### Insync hours

An hour to keep Insyncers in sync ;)

During this hour, the team is online together. You can ask questions, collaborate, ask for help, etc. Try to answer messages/requests/emails promptly during this time.

If you can't make it for collab hours, please let everyone know in advance on the **#interns** channel.

**Required: 1 hour, 2x a week.**

**Default: Tuesdays and Thursdays @ 1-2 PM **

--

Examples:
 * **@channel**: Anyone know how to resolve conflicts on git? Having some trouble.
 * Private message **@beatobongco**: hey, how do I set the web config?
 * **@gio**: Saw you're working on issue X. I have a few ideas! Let's set up a zoom meeting!

### "Chirps" / tweet ripoffs

![chirp](https://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/twittervsbatman.jpg)

In **140 characters or less**, updates on what you're doing today or what problems you're facing. Also, set your slack status to where you are so that we know if and where we can reach you.

** Required: Monday - Thursday @ 1PM. **

### Effing Fridays

A day where you demo what you've been doing for the week for just **5 minutes minimum**. Afterwards, there's knowledge-sharing sessions, free food and booze.

**Required: Fridays @ 2PM**

--

Examples:
 * Here's some minor UI changes to the homepage! Check it out at www.example.com.
 * Worked on some ideas on team processes. Here's the github link.
 * Stuck on this hard support problem with a business client. Here's what went down...

# 3 Action Items
## To be done ASAP!
--

### 1. Join the #interns slack channel ASAP!

This channel is **yours**.

Discuss ideas, collaborate, ask questions. Don't be shy. Get noisy!

--

### 2. Get yourself a project!

At the start, we'll assign you some issues with deadlines.

If you need/want to do more, check out the `intern` tags on the following repos:

* `insynchq/drivebox`
* `insynchq/data`
* `insynchq/web`.

--

#### Missing deadlines?

> *"Chronic schedule slippage is a morale- killer."*

> "*Take no small slips." That is, allow enough time in the new schedule to ensure that the work can be carefully and thoroughly done, and that rescheduling will not have to be done again.* - F. Brooks, The Mythical Man Month

--

**SOP:**

Post on the issue why you missed it and move the deadline forward.

Move it as far out as you need so you're completely sure you won't miss it again!

Gradually, you will get better at estimates.

--

### 3. Get to know the team!

Have 1 on 1 lunches / video calls with each member of the team. Food and/or drinks on the company!

* Get to know how this person fits into the company (so you know who to ask for help later on)
* Get to know this person as a person! :)
* After that, talk about anything under the sun whether work-related or not.

--

# That's all folks!
## Get ready for awesome! :D
