# Processes

Thought dump.

The biggest gist of all when implementing processes is making sure they're useful, easy to adapt, and to grow these processes organically.

Processes help you become more free as it becomes an efficient use of your time. Using processes should always result in having "more bang for your buck" meaning you get more work done in the same amount of time.

Processes aren't here to make you work HARD. We want you to work as SMART as possible so you can be more effective, help OTHERS be more effective, live your life how you want to.

Processes should not be additive:

Effectivity = me + you

They should make you and me more effective than we would have been working solo on different things:

Effectivity = process(me + you)

In any company:

* communication is lifeblood to a collective intelligence (ref: Superintelligence)
* people should spend a lot of time keeping in sync (ref: Zero to One)

Thus:
* invest in infrastructure that makes communication easier
  * software (zoom.us)
  * processes (quick meetings, deadline setting, collab hours)
  * environment (an office people would want to go to, Gio handling this)

Start of good habits:
* start setting single deadlines for big issues (no need to break it down if you dont want to)
* when failing to meet that deadline, comment on issue why it must be moved and move it far. (Take no small slips)
* write what really happened, don't ridicule others for what happened. **Psychological safety** is extremely important and should be part of the core of Insync. It makes Insync less of a job and more of a lifestyle and philosophy
* better to underpromise and overdeliver on schedules
* current aim is to reduce quantity of deadline movements
* building from these good habits, more effective and intricate processes make come about
* idea is to get foot in the door, making people think of good habits

Meeting rules:
* No useless meetings
* They can be quick as 5 minutes but point is you do have to have them

## Experiment: Intern Processes

Areas of focus on:
* Getting interns to know about how the company works
* Getting a good communication structure in place
* Getting good milestone-issues up
* Getting them to become friends and communicate amongst each other
* Getting interns to know about what each person in the company does via 1 on 1 lunches or chats (15 minutes).

Ideas:
* work however you want, just be effective.
* collaborate with others, respect them
* talk about non-work related things, have fun interacting

### Task distribution and goal setting

Give out tasks for interns with deadlines. Ask intern if OK with chosen deadline, if not ask the intern to revise.
Tell the intern it's great to be "noisy" in issues. Just write anything down and comment.

Tell the intern it's up to them to seek out help on issues via searching or collaboration.

To accomplish this, intern needs a good idea of what each Insync mentor does. This has to be done on onboarding.

When missing deadlines, ask them to write about why they missed it and when they want to move it.

### Mandatory stuff

Just three things:

* Tweet updates - every day, post a one-liner status of what you're doing on the #interns slack channel and if you're facing challenges.
* Collab hour - hour when the team is online together, working or just available for chat/talk. You don't need to do anything but be reachable. This is a good time to ask questions or ask for help if you're stuck. 1pm-2pm every T, Th.
* FF - present a minimum of 5 minutes on what you're doing, even if it's marginal improvement from last time or if you're stuck, show what you're stuck at. Free food and beer after. If you have requests, make it known on #effingfridays. Don't be shy! You can even buy the food/drinks yourself and be reimbursed! Every Friday 4pm.
