## Notes from YC's Startup School

### How and Why to Start a Startup by Sam Altman and Dustin Moskovitz

* Start for the right reasons: starting a startup to get rich is not the answer. You can gain more money, 
impact by joining another company. Start because it's something you're super passionate about and it's
your skills that can make it a reality. It has to be you.
* It's super stressful and time-consuming.
* Start with a cofounder, good friend.
* Start a hard company (e.g. General AI) vs facebook number 1million. It's about same difficulty anyway since 
startups are super hard.
* Startups are grit.
* Values, aptitude, specific skills. Humble.
* VC's usually invest in the founders.
* Know your users!!
* CEO: 40-50% building team.
* Team is paramount.
* Have a real mission and focus on it.

### Startup Mechanics by Kirsty Nathoo

* Start a C-corp, US, Delaware. No need to be there, to be a citizen. Get this done and done right else 
it will be expensive. https://www.clerky.com/
* Equity: more or less equal split because everything is ahead of you. Get this done and done right else 
it will be expensive.
* Vesting earning the right to permanent ownership of shares over time. 4 year vesting, 1 year cliff. 
1 year to get 0-25, succeeding years per month works up to 25% more up to 100% in 4 years.
* 83B Election, don't forget to file. Tax liability.
* Priced round vs non-priced/convertible round. 1 is shares sold for particular price, 2 is money now,
shares later.
* Equity: more shares are added when someone invests, diluting founder shares.
* SAFE: Simple Agreement for Future Equity. (covertible) they get bonus for investing early, but there's an 
upper bound to how much they can receive later. Doesn't require lawyers. Simple!
* Don't sell too much of the company early on.
* Be generous with equity at the start. 10% for the first 10 employees on a sliding scale. Vesting.
