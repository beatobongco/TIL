## Notes from YC's Startup School

### How to Get Ideas and How to Measure by Stewart Butterfield & Adam D'Angelo

* Pay attention to other people to get good ideas.
* Slack CEO: Give up on something when you've tried everything and don't have ideas for it anymore.

#### Metrics

* Active users
* Revenue
* Transactions
* Measure retention! Cohort analysis
* ring of fire - retain your users else your company wont last
* retention predicts high valuations - account expansion highest. Are your old users buying more?
* Graph growth rate of revenue instead of just revenue.
* Measure iteration time. Release daily if you can!
