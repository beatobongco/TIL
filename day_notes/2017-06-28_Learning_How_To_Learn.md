## Notes from Learning How to Learn from UC San Diego

* Timeboxing is effective (Pomodoro)
* Spaced Repetition is effective (Anki)
* Cramming is not effective. Learn a little everyday. Think lifting weights.
* **Metaphor + analogy** helps
* Focused vs diffuse learning. Switch between two to learn effectively. (alternate between learning and chilling)
* T. Sejnowski: Environment is important for learning. e.g. if you want to be creative surround yourself with and interact with creative people. 
This is further proof of why visionaries like Steve Jobs want to create environments where people bump into each
other a lot. This is why I don't believe in remote work. 
* Working memory sucks. Eliminate distraction.
* Sleep - consolidates what we learn, eliminates toxins.
* Exercise - allows processes to run in background and helps solve problems (Eureka moment)
* Benny the Irish Polyglot 
  * make a lot of mistakes to learn. Be OK with making mistakes.
  * self-fulfilling prophecies - whether you think you can or you can't you're right.
* Dr. Robert Bilder
  * expert on creativity
  * you need discomfort to learn
  * OCEAN (mine is 88-55-95-65-23) 
  * O - positive correlatins great achievement
  * A - negative correlation, challenge the status quo
  * powers on ten exercises - get perspective by super zooming out a problem then super zooming in
  * snake biting tail = benzene ring - serendipity - ideas that arise from subconscious
* Writing Coach Daphne Gray-Grant
  * Use mindmapping. If something is interesting/important/relevant to you, you will remember it.
  * Don't edit while you write. "Vomit" on page first and then edit later.
* Chunking 
  * Takes only one slot in working memory
  * Unite scattered bits of info through meaning.
  * Logical whole makes it easier to remember.
  * "Ah, gets" moments.
  * Makes your brain run more efficiently.
  * Chunking can be like creating a function in a programming language to abstract a series of steps. Once you've created it, you only need to remember the function name and what it does, not how it does it.
  * Top down and bottom up learning need to work together. (Memorization and understanding)
  * 1. Focus all your RAM on the task.
  * 2. Do a quick first pass to get the gist.
  * 3. Practice.
  * When a concept is chunked, it takes up less RAM freeing you to use it for other tasks.
* Recall
  * After learning something, look away and try to repeat in own words the main concepts.
  * Test yoself or wreck yoself!
* **Underline less and take notes more!** Underlining too much leads to illusions of competence.
* Test yourself in different places to not be dependent on subliminal cues where you learned the material. 
Argument of using highly mobile laptops and using Anki while on the go.
* **Combine chunks** - read widely - Gates/Jobs set aside week-long reading periods (perhaps different books) so that they can hold many ideas in mind during one time. This allows their ideas to "network" amongst themselves.
* **Transfer** - one chunk can be applied to many different unrelated fields.
* **Law of Serendipity** - Lady Luck favors the one who tries. 
* **Overlearning** - repeating what you already know. Waste of time. Think: climbing a lot of easy routes.
* **Deliberate practice** - focus intently on the parts of the problem that are more difficult to you.
* **Einstellung** - German: mindset - your initial thoughts may prevent a better idea from being found 
(close minded?). Beginner's mind?
* **Interleaving** - jump back and forth between problems which require different techinques or strategies. Mix up your learning. Builds flexibility and creativity. This is practice to be less book smart and more world smart.
* Innovate by mastering different fields. 
* Dr. Norman Fortenberry - director American Society for Engineering Education
  * You have to be part of team. Engineering is a team a sport. Find it as quickly as possible.
  * Impportant to take a break. Complete mental turnoff. 
  * Use all modes of input while learning. Sound, sight, touch (writing) etc.
* Scott Young - guy who compressed MIT CS course into 1 year of learning
  * Feynman technique: explain it to other people
  * Use analogy
  * Talent is just exposure
  * Best learners aren't put off by failure
  * MIT Open courseware is incredible https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm
