## Notes from Learning How to Learn from UC San Diego

* Timeboxing is effective (Pomodoro)
* Spaced Repetition is effective (Anki)
* Cramming is not effective. Learn a little everyday. Think lifting weights.
* Metaphor + analogy helps
* Focused vs diffuse learning. Switch between two to learn effectively. (alternate between learning and chilling)
* T. Sejnowski: Environment is important for learning. e.g. if you want to be creative surround yourself with and interact with creative people. 
This is further proof of why visionaries like Steve Jobs want to create environments where people bump into each
other a lot. This is why I don't believe in remote work. 
* Working memory sucks. Eliminate distraction.
* Sleep - consolidates what we learn, eliminates toxins.
* Exercise - allows processes to run in background and helps solve problems (Eureka moment)
* Benny the Irish Polyglot 
  - make a lot of mistakes to learn. Be OK with making mistakes.
  - self-fulfilling prophecies - whether you think you can or you can't you're right.
* Dr. Robert Bilder
 - expert on creativity
 - you need discomfort to learn
 - OCEAN (mine is 88-55-95-65-23) 
 - O - positive correlatins great achievement
 - A - negative correlation, challenge the status quo
 - powers on ten exercises - get perspective by super zooming out a problem then super zooming in
 - snake biting tail = benzene ring - serendipity - ideas that arise from subconscious
