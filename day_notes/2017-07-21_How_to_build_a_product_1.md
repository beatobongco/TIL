Your most angry users can become your most loyal ones if you treat them right. 

Talk to the users who didn't choose to use your product.

Launch sooner rather than later. It's OK to launch something that is jury-rigged, doesn't scale. 
Just make sure the value-add is extremely compelling to some people.

You need minimum viable data. Track some shit from day 1 even if you don't use it yet.

**Pick your 5-7 most important user actions and log them.**

Your users don't care about your tech. 

Fix things one at a time, do not wait to fix many things then release. Release early and often.

Talk to users, look at data, not to validate products ideas but to HAVE product ideas.
