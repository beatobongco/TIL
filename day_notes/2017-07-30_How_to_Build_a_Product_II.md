 Aaron Levie, CEO and co-founder of Box talked about enterprise software.
 
 * Start with a toy, one usecase that everyone has a problem with.
 * Do one thing better than everyone else
 * If building for enterprise, move like a consumer company.
 * Make sure you're benefitting form a technological tailwind, grow with a trend.
 * Build always for the user, not for the buyer.
 * Don't build things that aren't your core competency, use best in breed.
 * A lot of enterprise products focus on building too many features. You can make simplicity one of your value props.
 * Don't shout.
