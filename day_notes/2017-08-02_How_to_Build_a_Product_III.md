* dotcloud prev docker was a consultancy, running a consultancy will take up all your time and you wont have time to make a product
* deal with bad hires early, don't allow them to fester. It's a waste of both your time but it's your fault for hiring. 
* docker meetup: it grew organically. Community got a mind of its own and the company just removes roadblocks 
and enables the community.  
* what if you have a big competitor with large scale? As a small startup, use your focus and speed. 
You have to be aligned and unified and be outward facing.
* why do people refer? Because your product saves **time**
* remember to do things that dont scale at the start
