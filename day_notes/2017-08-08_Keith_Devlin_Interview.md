* Don't panic - keep it slow. Understand the problem. Kinda looks like rapid prototyping.
* When you hit a wall, go out for a climb :)
* Use "evolution" as your friend. We didn't evolve to solve abstract problems, we solve social, spatial, etc problems.
If we can frame problems this way, it can be a useful tool. 
* Because we didn't evolve to solve problems this way, we have to build mental scaffolding which takes time. 
You have to bang away at it.
* Common pattern: exercise. 
* Cliff Nass at Stanford research: human beings cannot multitask. Note that multitasking is different from interleaving.
* Don't multitask, serial task.
* **You can't do everything, just do as much as you reasonably can**
* I don't want things pushed to me. No notifs, no distractions.
