* Single most important thing for growth: Retention
* MAU is most important active user count
* Retention curve goes up because of stuff like network effects, adding categories, etc
* Growth accounting
```
+ New users
- churning users
+ resurrecting users
```
* Non-scalable: what is the best thing about our product? Why do you love our product?
* Scalable: correlations (needs a lot of app tracking)
* "North Star" metric. Align on a singular metric. Retention is good.
* Retention, churn, resurrection, channels?
* Where is your funnel leaking?
* Data debt sucks. Track all the shit!
* Data gives you empathy about your users
* Need product market fit, retention to drive growth
* Don't look at total ROI for ads, look at last dollar spent (diminishing returns)
* Optimize notifications (push, SMS, email) for marginal users not for the power users
* Personalize for the user
* FB ads: Custom audiences + lookalike targeting
* For targeting, most important is behavior and not demographic
* Heirarchy: channel -> targeting -> creative
* Use good wording: `Create ad` vs `Advertise`
* !! Put the registration form on the landing page
* Changing the target page of your ad is important (don't just drive them to homepage/registration page)
* Data helps you move fast
* A good plan violently executed today is better than a perfect one executed next week.
