* Industry vs an increment, like what Thiel meant when he said go from Zero to One
* The Dream Machine - M. Waldrop - book on xerox parc / arpa
* Check out SketchPad, made really long ago. A object oriented program that could draw parts, create instances of them and adjust.
* It shows that a lot of cool things are happening in the cutting-edge, and whatever is consumer is old tech already.
* In 1968 a lot of cool things were invented already, like the stylus, "VR"
* The super scientists before cared about "advancing something very important", it was a vision and not a goal.

### How to invent the future in steps
1. Get a "cosmic goodness" intuition
2. Identify favorable exponentials (Moore's Law, crypto, AI)
3. Take the intuition out 30 years.
4. Can we say it would be ridiculous if we didn't have this? If YES, that's great.
5. Go out to T+10-15 years. Can something be done?

"Invent the future from the future. Go out there and bring it back".
