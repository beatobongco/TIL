* Knowledge is silver, context is gold, IQ is lead.
* How does someone gain context? 
* Can't learn to see if don't admit we're blind.
* Humanity's default state is crazy (haha)
* We are born into systems. 
* A large part of our mind fights what we can learn.
* We are born into systems which shape our way of thinking, for example
we're familiar with the main OS's Win, Mac, Linux but they're all old ideas
that emerged in the 60's. Kay's point is that we should see past that when trying
to invent the future. Perhaps the future can be invented by looking at the innovations 
of the past and to see if there's infrastructure that supports it already.
* Find ways of criticizing what seems normal / the norm.
