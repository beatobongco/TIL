* vs Alan Kay who says you have to look far out to invent the future, Reinhardt says it's good for research
but no so great to start a company. You have to solve a current problem and talk to customers
* Common mistake of startups is to solve problems no one has - PG
* 80% of all founders fail to find product market fit (where does this statistic come from?
* The first foothold (problem to solve) is the most important, easy to scale out
* Be a cockroach, extend runway as long as possible
* Getting your startup to these revs:

* Because the start is a brutal grind. 
* Not much learning in failing to find product market fit (???) 
* Product-market fit feels haywire, people going gaga over your shit
* Expect lots of pivoting
* segment's first PM-fit was 580 lines of code vs their initial product of 100k+ lines
* PM fit doesn't feel tepid; not idle interest or pity usage
* PM fit feels like stepping on a landmine
* Problem is not killing the bad ideas fast enough (!!)
* The size of the problem has nothing to do with the lines of code 
* You have to keep testing the value $$ of your product, dont be afraid to charge high, you can nego down
* When you talk to your customers do not pitch to them, ask about their problems
* Be OK with single percentage numbers when doing sales / cold emails
* Build platforms (old hat yeah)
