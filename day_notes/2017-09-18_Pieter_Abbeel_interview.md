* He chose AI because he likes engineering, building things. AI won out because it seemed like it could affect
all disciplines. It could be the core of all disciplines. 
* Deep reinforcement learning
* Supervised learning: I/O mapping
* Reinforcement learning: where does the data come from? Credit assignment
* He looks like Johnny Sins - Miggy
* How to get systems to reason over long horizons
* Right now systems do well over short horizons, like 5 seconds, and can act well over the entire problem. 
* How do you learn safely and keep learning once you're pretty good?
* Best advice he received (it was from Ng) what impact can it (your work?) have, rather than what's the math that happens to be in your work.
* It's a really good time to get into AI. You can study on your own.
* UC Berkeley has a deep reinforcement learning course online (!!!)
* Don't just read things, try them out (ouch, I need to do this)
* Can try Kaggle to improve self
* It starts with supervised learning, mimic the human, then can go to reinforcement learning
