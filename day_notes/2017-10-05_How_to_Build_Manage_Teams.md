* Company becomes the people it hires
* It's not about your idea, it's about your team + being in a rich space
* Building the right team (esp first 10) is extremely important
* The best people cant be interviewed. They have to be sold on the idea.
* Think big and act small (?)
* Think of hiring as managing risk (Gene Pool Engineering)
* Identify key areas of risk, get 1-5 names in this area and try to hire them
* People who have spent 10-15 years in a big company are usually bad fits for startups
* Founder's role: leadership: belief system in the face of ambiguity 
* One of the jobs of a founder: Know whose judgement to trust on what topic.
* Great talent is never too expensive

From some random YouTuber:

- Company becomes the people it hires, not the plan 
- Your starting plan becomes much less relevant than the first 10 people you hire 
- Those 10 people will hire the next 100 
- You can fire the first 10, but their DNA will stay in the company (in their hires) after they leave 
- Difference between 0-millions and 0-billions is attitudes and the team you build 
- It's very hard to hire those skills later 
- The best people almost can't be interviewed. They have to be sold. 
- Be obstinate about your vision, but be flexible about your tactics. Think big. Act small. 
- Identify your top 5 risks. Hire for these risks. 
- Early startups need innovation, not process. Large companies 90% same thing year over year (need good process at that point, not before). 
- Founder's role is leadership and vision. You can't hire it. 
- Give a lot of equity (15%) because great founders will leave and create their own startup instead 
- "Think about who you could get that everybody would want to work with you" (great hires are magnets) 
- People will stay for the vision. And people around them who are awesome and that they can learn from. 
- The people you hire will influence your path in the future. Get people open to change. 
- Hire wide brains that also are good in their specialty 
- Interviews. "You can never rely on the direct answer you get." Poser la même question 3-4 fois (What are you good at? What was your strength in that position? When you join our business, what do you think will be your #1 strength?
- Khosla has 65% success rate
- Overhire: if you want 4 people on your team, hire 6
- A great talent is never too expensive to hire (e.g. 15 M in preferred stock)
- Assimilate people and help them be successful in your business﻿
