* Invented GANs generative adversarial networks

From wikipedia:

Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a class of artificial intelligence algorithms used in unsupervised machine learning, implemented by a system of two neural networks contesting with each other in a zero-sum game framework. They were introduced by Ian Goodfellow et al. in 2014.[1]

This technique can generate photographs that look authentic to human observers. For example, a GAN can be used to generate a synthetic photograph of a cat that fools the discriminator into accepting it as an actual photograph.[2]

* Had a "near death experience" (it was just a super bad headache) where all he could think about was he wished someone
would try out his research ideas
* There's a lot of things to do / paths to take in AI: 
Do you want to make reinforcement learning work? Unsupervised? Make sure AI is fair? Societal issues?
* One way to break in would be to post good code in Github and get noticed.
* I need to start making open source projects, even just toys.
* Adversarial networks - beginning of new field called ML security (you can fool ML algorithms to do things they
shouldn't)
