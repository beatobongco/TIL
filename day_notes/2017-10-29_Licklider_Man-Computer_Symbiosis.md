* Holy shit this was made in the 1950's!
* Not "mechanically extended man", but like symbiosis in nature.
* "to think in interaction with a computer in the same way you think with a colleague whose competence supplements your own
will require much tighter coupling between man and machine than is possible today" - that's why Musk is trying to do that coupling with Neuralink.
* With work, we spend a lot of time doing clerical or mechanics tasks, preparing to think rather than actually thinking.
Moreover, choices were made based on clerical feasibility and not intellectual capability. These can all be automated, Lick says.
* If there's a symbiotic relationship between man and a fast information-retrieval and data-processing machine, this would 
greatly improve the thinking process. AN: That's what I'm trying to do with book-highlights and notes, and having these
easily accessible on mobile. Even if this is not "AI", it can offset our brittle and fragile memory. I'm just not sure how to
go about enhancing data-processing. My current lead is that we have our smartphones, tiny computers in our pocket and they
are usually just idle or using their processing power for stupid things like mobile games or social media. They could be
converted into brain aids and that's what I want to do.
* People are anti-fragile, capable of changing goals based on new data. They also have a lot of things going on at at time. Computers at their current state aren't this way. People can cover machines' weaknesses and vice-versa so symbiosis just 
kinda makes sense.
* Men will lead the way, define the question, handle all the low-probability scenarios.
