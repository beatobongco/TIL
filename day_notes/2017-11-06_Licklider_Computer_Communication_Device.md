# Licklider: The Computer as a Communications Device

* "When minds interact, new ideas emerge."
* "a well programmed computer can provide direct access both to informational resources and to the processes for making use of 
the resources." The crux of the question is: once we get retrieval help down (searching through notes and highlights from
important papers, conversations, and thoughts), how can we program computers to help us make use of it better? It's highly 
situation-dependent but maybe some sort of generalized help can be provided.
* The problem with models of the mind is that they're super different per person. "It can only be observed and manipulated by
one person." Standardization may work I guess, but it wont be as blazing fast and will require some overhead from users. 
Maybe the question is, can the current UI for learnign tools be improved? Or can an smartphone app be developed that's a sort
of brain aid. e.g. full text and in-context search and combination of ideas. Auto and on-demand mindmapping? Perhaps an approach
would be to map out human weaknesses and biases (Kahneman) and program general features that prevent these from being triggered.
* People need a common model, "cooperative modelling", to collaborate.
* Lick talks about relevance of facial expression or non-verbal communication (I believe it is very important) vs creation and 
modification of external models.
* Difference in mental models:

* If 2 different mental models are just different because of the parameters, by communicating they will converge. This is the
easiest type of communication.
* Meeting of many minds is even more difficult. This was touched upon also by Brooks in the Mythical Man Month.
* > A particular form of digital computer organization, with its programs and data, constitutes the dynamic, moldable medium that can revolutionize the art of modeling and that in doing so can improve the effectiveness of communication among people so much as perhaps to revolutionize that also.
* It's MODELLING that is KEY.
> To appreciate the importance the new computer-aided communication can have, one must consider the dynamics of “critical mass,” as it applies to cooperation in creative endeavor. Take any problem worthy of the name, and you find only a few people who can contribute effectively to its solution. Those people must be brought into close intellectual partnership so that their ideas can come into contact with one another. But bring these people together physically in one place to form a team, and you have trouble, for the most creative people are often not the best team players, and there are not enough top positions in a single organization to keep them all happy. Let them go their separate ways, and each creates his own empire, large or small, and devotes more time to the role of emperor than to the role of problem solver. The principals still get together at meetings. They still visit one another. But the time scale of their communication stretches out, and the correlations among mental models degenerate between meetings so that it may take a year to do a week’s communicating. There has to be some way of facilitating communicant ion among people without bringing them together in one place.
* Well, Lick predicted the internet...and reddit.
* Concept for online assistant called OLIVER "on-line interactive vicarious expediter and responder" (from Oliver Selfridge)
* OLIVER is self-learning
> There will be plenty of opportunity for everyone (who can afford a console) to find his calling, for the whole world of information, with all its fields and disciplines, will be open to him—with programs ready to guide him or to help him explore
* Oh that was the dream and still is the dream. And that it would end employment because everyone would be caught up in infinite online interactive debugging
