# The Power of Context - Alan Kay (2004)

* Ideas have came to Kay as more of rotations of point of view than incremental progress.
* > A fish on land still waves its fins, but the results are qualitatively different when the fish is put in its most suitable watery environment.
* There's just too many of these signals to ignore. Environment matters a lot!
* Context is worth 80 IQ points.
* ARPA/PARC - "visions not goals", "funded people, not projects". Ties in with antifragility, rational flaneur.
* > The pursuit of Art always sets off plans and goals, but plans and goals don't always give rise to Art. If "visions not goals" opens the heavens, it is important to find artistic people to conceive the projects.
* > The vision was "interactive computing as a complementary intellectual partner for people pervasively networked world-wide". 
* > a great vision acts like a magnetic field from the future that aligns all the little iron particle artists to point to “North” without having to see it. They then make their own paths to the future.
* Ask Prof. Kay: Which signals point North now? How can we use ML/AI to help further this vision?
* > Our game is more like art and sports than accounting, in that high percentages of failure are quite OK as long as enough larger processes succeed.
* People who don't agree with this: They are trying to "avoid failure" rather than trying to "capture the heavens".
* Again like in Antifragile, stochastic tinkering can lead to large positive black swans. Constant small failtures are OK as they increase antifragility.
* Butler Lampson, 2 general principles: don't make anything that can't handle 100 users, use own creations as main computing systems (dogfooding!). Result: many projects got sped up almost a year!
* Ask Prof. Kay: is stuff like this happening still in the modern age? Why not?
* Kay Champions incremental creation: things being grown into being. Kind of like Spotify's skateboard methology.
* You should build your own tools, only if you really can do better than existing ones, otherwise don't.
* The best way to predict the future is to invent it. (!!!)
* Doug Engelbart's big ideas about "augmenting the collective intelligence of groups working together" have still not taken hold in commercial systems. (Ask Prof. Kay for this paper/s, but first check references)
* > most computing is still aimed at adults in business, and that aimed at nonbusiness and children is mainly for entertainment and apes the worst of television. We see almost no use in education of what is great and unique about computer modeling and computer thinking. These are not technological problems but a lack of perspective. Must we hope that the open-source software movements will put things right?
