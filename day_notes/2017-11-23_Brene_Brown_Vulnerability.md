* people she interviewed (for a study on vulnerability) she could divide into 2. People who had
"worthiness" and people who didn't.
* Worthiness - people who have a strong sense of love and belonging because they believe they are
worth of it
* She calls them "wholehearted"
* they had the courage to be imperfect
* we can't have compassion if we don't have compassion for ourselves
* they were willing to let go of who they should be in order to be who they were (!!!)
* they fully embraced vulnerability - what made the vulnerable made them beautiful
* they saw it as being necessary, not comfortable, not excruciating
* willingness to do something without guarantee
* willingness to invest in a relationship that may or may not work out
