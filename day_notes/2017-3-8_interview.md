“Whenever we can replace human judgment by a formula, we should at least consider it.”

According to Daniel Kahneman in his book Thinking Fast and Slow...

The surprising success of equal-weighting schemes has an important practical implication: it is possible to develop useful algorithms without any prior statistical research. Simple equally weighted formulas based on existing statistics or on common sense are often very good predictors of significant outcomes.

First, select a few traits that are prerequisites for success in this position (technical proficiency, engaging personality, reliability, and so on). Don’t overdo it—six dimensions is a good number. The traits you choose should be as independent as possible from each other, and you should feel that you can assess them reliably by asking a few factual questions. Next, make a list of those questions for each trait and think about how you will score it, say on a 1–5 scale. You should have an idea of what you will call “very weak”or “very strong.”

To avoid halo effects, you must collect the information on one trait at a time, scoring each before you move on to the next one. Do not skip around. To evaluate each candidate, add up the six scores. Because you are in charge of the final decision, you should not do a “close your eyes.” Firmly resolve that you will hire the candidate whose final score is the highest, even if there is another one whom you like better— try to resist your wish to invent broken legs to change the ranking.

For Insync's profile it's probably (in no specific order)...

## Initiative

Being able to self-manage and follow-up. Not needing micro-management.

Tell me a story of when you wanted something really bad but there was nobody to guide you. Doesn't matter if you got it or not.

```
1 - I wanted to be the best tennis player. I just am not naturally talented so I gave up.
3 - I wanted to be the best tennis player so I went to practice with other people 3x a week.
5 - I wanted to be the best tennis player so I read books, bought specialized training equipment and am following a specific training program. I joined comps later on.
```

## Character

How do you treat people who can't do anything for you.

Your group failed. How do you treat a groupmate who let you down? Where do you draw the line between compassion and being lax?
You will have future projects with this group.

```
1 - Just forgive him. /  Kick him out of the group.
3 - Forgive him but help him be better / Assess objectively. Reprimand him or kick him out based on impartial data.
5 - Realize the others and I am at fault also for not helping this person. We should all work together to improve.
```

## Passion

Being an uber nerd about something. Doesn't have to be related to tech.

Tell me about something you're passionate about.

```
1 - I kinda like trains.
3 - I love trains! I update myself with the latest and greatest. You heard of the Hyperloop?
5 - HOLY SHIT I LOVE TRAINS! Let me tell about the history of steam engines and how that influenced train tech today... (30 mins of train talk ensues)
```

## Determination

Not getting frustrated and giving up easily. Gonna do dis shit no matter what.

Tell me about a time you faced a difficult problem.

```
1 - I couldn't get the code to work. I tried tho.
3 - I couldn't get the code to work so I went through it line by line.
5 - I couldn't get the effing code to work so I drank extra joss and coffee together and didn't sleep. I failed but a week later I still finished it because pride.
```

## Lateral thinking

Solving problems by an indirect and creative approach.

How would you revolutionize an object?

```
1 - I would make a better pen. It would be like a Montblanc but better.
3 - I would make a better pen. It would work under water and in zero gravity!
5 - I would make a better pen. (procceds to talk about wacky intersection of surprising things that make sense from a usability / market perspective)
```

## Technical proficiency

Determined by code board.

```
1 - lots of mistakes
3 - everything works but things could be optimized / documented better
5 - perfectly efficient solutions / well documented
```

## Evaluation

We're going for > 23.
