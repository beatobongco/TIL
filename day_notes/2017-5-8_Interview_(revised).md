# Interview v2.0

Changes in this version:

* Combined Initiative and Determination into one trait, Determined Independence.
* Lateral thinking changed to Entrepreneurial skill.
* Technical proficiency is now rated by Marte via the code board.
* There are 2 questions per trait, first is based on real life experiences and next is hypothetical situation. Hypothetical question will only be used when they don't have a relevant story to share.

# Introduction

# Interview Questions 

## Determined Independence

Being able to self-manage and follow-up. Not needing micro-management. Not getting frustrated and giving up easily. Gonna do dis shit no matter what.

Question 1: Tell me about a time you faced a big challenge on your own. It can be a personal project, school requirement, or a goal. How did you overcome?
Question 2: If I told you to extend an existing codebase, say a billing system, within one week how would you feel? What if I didn't message you or check up on you? How would you do it?

```
1 - <Worked on it> / I wouldn't feel comfortable with it but I would try my best. I want a bit of supervision and help.
3 - <Worked hard on it> / I'll feel a little uncomfortable but will rise to the challenge. I'll try to complete it best as I can.
5 - <Worked hard and was very resourceful> / I'll do my best to complete it. I'll search online and if I can't find it, I'll PM you questions.
```

## Character

> Be nice. Care

How do you treat people who can't do anything for you. How nice you are. How much you care.

Question 1: Are you engaged in any organizations that help other people? 
Question 2: Your group failed. How do you treat a groupmate who let you down? Where do you draw the line between compassion and being lax?
You will have future projects with this group.

```
1 - No. I don't want. / Just forgive him or kick him out of the group.
3 - Yes, I'm part of this org and help out from time to time. / Forgive him but help him be better. Assess objectively. Reprimand him or kick him out based on impartial data.
5 - Yes, I'm part of this org. I hold this position or I really just enjoy it. / Realize the others and I am at fault also for not helping this person. We should all work together to improve.
```

## Passion

Being an uber nerd about something. Doesn't have to be related to tech.

Question 1: Tell me about something you're passionate about.
Question 2: Automatic 0.

```
1 - I kinda like trains.
3 - I love trains! I update myself with the latest and greatest. You heard of the Hyperloop?
5 - HOLY SHIT I LOVE TRAINS! Let me tell about the history of steam engines and how that influenced train tech today... (30 mins of train talk ensues)
```

## Entrepreneurial skill

Question 1: Do you want to start your own startup?
Question 2: If you were to own a startup, what would it be?

```
1 - No. / <crappy startup idea>
3 - Yes. / <moderate startup idea, even if its been done before>
5 - Yes! Thought about this before, here's the rough idea and how to build/market it. 
```

## Technical proficiency

Determined by Marte with code board.

```
1 - lots of mistakes
3 - everything works but things could be optimized / documented better
5 - perfectly efficient solutions / well documented
```

“Whenever we can replace human judgment by a formula, we should at least consider it.”

The surprising success of equal-weighting schemes has an important practical implication: it is possible to develop useful algorithms without any prior statistical research. Simple equally weighted formulas based on existing statistics or on common sense are often very good predictors of significant outcomes.

First, select a few traits that are prerequisites for success in this position (technical proficiency, engaging personality, reliability, and so on). Don’t overdo it—six dimensions is a good number. The traits you choose should be as independent as possible from each other, and you should feel that you can assess them reliably by asking a few factual questions. Next, make a list of those questions for each trait and think about how you will score it, say on a 1–5 scale. You should have an idea of what you will call “very weak”or “very strong.”

To avoid halo effects, you must collect the information on one trait at a time, scoring each before you move on to the next one. Do not skip around. To evaluate each candidate, add up the six scores. Because you are in charge of the final decision, you should not do a “close your eyes.” Firmly resolve that you will hire the candidate whose final score is the highest, even if there is another one whom you like better— try to resist your wish to invent broken legs to change the ranking.
