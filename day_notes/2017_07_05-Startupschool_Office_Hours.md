* Get your messaging right. One core value prop.
* Build a monopoly
* Launch sooner rather than later, even if you're embarrassed.
* You recommend the price, people will usually follow.
* Do it manually for now. Just get it out. Do things that don't scale or better put, don't worry if a 
"huge influx" of users will come tomorrow and crash your site.
