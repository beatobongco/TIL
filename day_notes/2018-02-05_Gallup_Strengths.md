## Notes from Gallup's Strengths Finder

SELFSEARCH:NOINDEX

The above is an experimental tag so my own little search engine doesn't index this article, though it is still available online for the persistent and curious.

1. Activator
2. Woo
3. Communication
4. Positivity
5. Strategic

## Activator

* Look for creative, futuristic thinkers and help them move their ideas from ideas to action.
* I learn from XP, I have to remember to keep doing hard things.
* I can use Activator on myself, to turn theoretical knowledge from books into action (like what I did with Thinking Fast and Slow). Remember to cite your sources, it helps people from thinking you're a "ready, fire, aim" person.

## Communication
* Practice your storytelling, it's currently lacking. You don't talk about yourself because of Carnegie, but being vulnerable is part of being genuine and that's what you want. You can keep it interesting (simple and brief) with good storytelling.
* The simpler you can explain it the better, especially with easy to digest analogies (they play with already built chunks of the audience)
* When presenting, get feedback by paying attention to the audience. You currently don't because you're afraid of losing your train of thought. Take note of engaging parts, try to dissect what you did and then iterate.
* Before using this ability, practice. Even simple priming will do wonders, like when you hosted your brother's wedding. Winging it is never the answer. Practice + improv is the answer. 
* Always say yes to opportunities to present. It's not just fun, it's strategic practice.
* Identify your audience/market. There are some people you really flow with when you speak to them. Try to hang with these people.
* I can use communication to foster communication in others who are not natural communicators.
* Find a medium for your comms. Blog + strategic social media use.

To be cont'd

* Because people share intimate details of their lives with me, I must rememember to keep their confidence even if they hadn't explicitly told me to keep a secret.
