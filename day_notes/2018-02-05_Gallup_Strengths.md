## Notes from Gallup's Strengths Finder

SELFSEARCH:NOINDEX

The above is an experimental tag so my own little search engine doesn't index this article, though it is still available online for the persistent and curious.

1. Activator
2. Woo
3. Communication
4. Positivity
5. Strategic

## Activator

* Look for creative, futuristic thinkers and help them move their ideas from ideas to action.
* I learn from XP, I have to remember to keep doing hard things.
* I can use Activator on myself, to turn theoretical knowledge from books into action (like what I did with Thinking Fast and Slow). Remember to cite your sources, it helps people from thinking you're a "ready, fire, aim" person.

## Woo

* I should check up on people once a month, it says on the book. I agree but I'm forgetful so I need a system to manage this! Could be a nice Hack Fridays app. This system can include little notes on the person too.
* Take responsibility for putting reserved people at ease.
* Bring talented people together and help them collaborate - my Insync monthly party idea, when we become successful
* Whenever possible be one of the first people other meet in events
* Do your homework. Research people before meeting them.
* Because people (sometimes near strangers) share intimate details of their lives with me, I must rememember to keep their confidence even if they hadn't explicitly told me to keep a secret.

## Communication
* Practice your storytelling, it's currently lacking. You don't talk about yourself because of Carnegie, but being vulnerable is part of being genuine and that's what you want. You can keep it interesting (simple and brief) with good storytelling.
* The simpler you can explain it the better, especially with easy to digest analogies (they play with already built chunks of the audience)
* When presenting, get feedback by paying attention to the audience. You currently don't because you're afraid of losing your train of thought. Take note of engaging parts, try to dissect what you did and then iterate.
* Before using this ability, practice. Even simple priming will do wonders, like when you hosted your brother's wedding. Winging it is never the answer. Practice + improv is the answer. 
* Always say yes to opportunities to present. It's not just fun, it's strategic practice.
* Identify your audience/market. There are some people you really flow with when you speak to them. Try to hang with these people.
* I can use communication to foster communication in others who are not natural communicators.
* Find a medium for your comms. Blog + strategic social media use.

## Positivity

* Go for leadership positions
* Plan highlight activities for friends and colleagues (yay, this is fun!)
* You get joy from encouraging people (yas). Make praise very specific.
* Avoid chronically negative people BUT if you can ease their pain do so wholeheartedly.
* Book repeats this twice: make people understand you're not naive. Ground your positivity on real data (which it mostly is grounded on)
* Arm self with good stories, jokes, and sayings (I have sayings but few of the previous two).
* Efficient: if person is alreay positive, you can be the spark that lights the fire AND gain energy. Helping negative people out is possbile but drains your energy. Use your energy wisely.

## Strategic

* Musing time is essential for strategic people so take long walks or muni muni from time to time
* Leadership is stressed again.
* Seems that planning is ecouraged to maximize this strength
* Trust your intuition as often as possible even if you cant explain them rationally. Your intuitions are created by a brain that instinctively anticipates and projects
* Involve yourself in the start of new initiatives or enterprises
