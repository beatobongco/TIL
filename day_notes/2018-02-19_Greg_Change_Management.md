## Objectives

1. Get general overview of the field. What are the basics of good change management?
2. Give outline of where Insync is at currently and its problems. 
  * Good team of smart, independent individuals 
  * Constant schedule slippage
  * No metrics
  * People used to having no processes 
  * Management debt 
3. Get specific advice. Where should one start?

Main things: 
  * Readiness
    * assessing the environment, understand demographic, needs
    * planning for the change
  * Communication 
    * communicating the change - its not something you do once, it's something you have to do as regularly as you can
  * Training
    * ensuring they have the the right skills to do the change you're implementing
  
Agile - sprints, you have a product backlog - list of features you want to implement. You have a meeting - owner is PM - you discuss the most important features and then prioritize. Talk amongst the devs. Estimation - measured by weight (or time, whatever works). Cards - 1, 3, 5, 7 days - each dev will show cards together and ask why. Once you agree, start your sprint (a week or two weeks). Sprint review. During sprints you have standup meetings everyday. During sprints, you can't pull people out. 

**Involve an executive in CM.** 

Best metric - Github issues closed per week vs last week. Important to set targets, but maybe start with no target. Track how much they're doing. 

Tie it with incentives. It has to be enticing/fun. 

Something like lunch/food voucher?

Tradeoff: productivity vs. freedom -> we have to be aligned. T and Marte. 

Sprints are autonomous - hours dont matter its output based. Every day standups. Rhythm/routine at the same time in the morning. 

Read up - Agile development. 

Get feedback from executives. 

You have a current state, you have a future state -> you need to get buy in

Stagger the change - start with early adopters (maybe 10%) like a rehearsal before the final show.
