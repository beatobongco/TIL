# Week 1

## Manifesto

* Individuals and interactions - over processes and tools
* Working software - over comprehensive documentation
* Customer collaboration - over contract negotiation
* Responding to change - over following a plan

## 12 Principles

* early and continuous delivery of valuable software 
* welcome changing requirements, even late in development
* deliver software frequently
* business people x developers work together daily
* build projects around motivated individuals. Give them env and support
* face-to-face conversation to convey information
* working software is the primary measure of progress
* sustainable development -- dont overwork!
* technical excellence + good design = enhanced agility 
* simplicity is essential (via negativa, maximize work not done)
* self-organizing teams -- dont overmanage
* at regular intervals, team reflects on how to be better and then inacts the change

## Agile Methods

### XP

Extreme programming. 

Kent Beck. 

Not documentation but programs and programming at the center. 

### Lean

Mary Poppendieck.

Lean (from Toyota Production System, also Lean startup!).

Get rid of waste.

### Crystal

Alistair Cockburn.

Combination of agile and traditional.

### Scrum

Schwaber and Sutherland.

Currently dominates.

Self-organizing teams. Short release iterations like sprints.

In practice, when we talk about agile we talk about Scrum. Not entirely accurate.

### Principles in depth

Principles - abstract, prescriptive
Practice - concrete, prescriptive
Assertion - statement about the world

Testing is absent.

### Agile Values

* reduced role for manager -- do not assign tasks to project members
* no "big upfront" steps -- requirements and development as you go, no long periods of planning
* iterative development -- short cycles
* limited, negotiated scope -- only build what's really needed
* focus on quality, achieved through testing
