# Culture of Testing

## 3 Pillars 

These pillars help build a culture of testing and must be reinforced by incentives as much as they can.

### I. Ownership

> No bystanders allowed.

If no one owns a certain test case, chances are it will not be done. Recall [Kitty Genovese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Kitty_Genovese) and how the [bystander effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bystander_effect) prevented people from saving her. 

If people start being responsible for test cases there is ownership and thus more responsibility.

### II. Testing as a fun team activity

> Energy is infectious.

> Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow - Linus' Law

To prevent procrastination, testing should be done as a team effort. Fun is an important prerequisite to the adoption of this cultural trait as well as positive peer pressure. When your peers all around you are testing you will feel more motivated to do the same. 

### III. Testing as less work

> An ounce of prevention is better than a pound of cure.

There is some upfront work required by testing but the value is quickly realized when there are less support issues and less bugs to fix. Our pace of feature development increases as well since this means less regression errors.


## Proposed Testing Process

This process is facilitated by the Head of Testing.

1. Before a new feature is released internally, the feature owner writes down in a Google Sheets tracker what the feature is supposed to do and some test cases. These test cases are short and in simple english. These cases need not be exhaustive.

2. Each person is assigned test cases has his or her own sheet in the tracker where they will write details about their testing. 

3. When the feature is released internally, a common date is picked where the whole company comes together to test for just one hour. If you complete your assigned test cases before the time is up proceed to try breaking the feature in your own way. 

4. Since the bulk of testing is done in a day, the feature owner may now fix the largest bugs and this process can be repeated as needed.
