# Interview v3.0 (tailored for developers)

If you're an interviewee and you're reading this, that's an awesome sign of your resourcefulness. You may use these questions to your benefit however be honest and let me know you've seen this beforehand. 

Changes in this version:

* Improved introductory guide questions
* Classified interview questions as `trait questions`
* Tuned scoring trait questions to be more relevant for full-time developers

Before starting the process, make sure the code board for interviewee has already been scored.

## Introductory Guide Questions

### Expectation setting

1. Why do you want this job?
2. What are the top 3 things you want if you get this job? ex. freedom, mentorship, progression
3. What do you want out of life?

### Person-Company Fit

Ask preliminary questions to gauge interest in the company and fit.

1. Do you know what Insync currently does?
2. Do you know what we aim to become? (Vision; explain if he/she doesn't know)
3. How do you feel about the vision?

### Provide baseline information

#### Company

1. History
	* https://beatobongco.com/TIL/presentations/2017-05-31_Insync_History.html
2. Mission and vision
	* https://sites.google.com/insynchq.com/guide/
3. Culture
	* be open, be nice, care 
		* psychological safety
	* remote working culture after 30 days intensive onboarding
	* a place for creative, independent people who get shit done who value their time and freedom
	* good (data-driven if available) ideas always win

#### Tech Stack

* Gist: syncing is a hard problem. Cross platform is hard too.
	* Keeping state consistent and operations recoverable, handling errors, making sure the app can be installed and works cross-platform.
* Languages: Python, Javascript, Objective C, C
* Frameworks: Flask, React, Vue
* Libraries: gevent, pytest, PyObjc, py2app, ctypes, pywin32, comtypes
* Others: Docker, MySQL

#### Functional Stack

* JTBD
* Agile

#### Growth and Mentorship

* Create your own role. Progression here is the creation of your own role with corresponding responsibility and salary increase.
* Self-learners are greatly valued 
* Weekly mentorship is available. Style: if knowledge is a tree, we guide you to the correct branches you need to navigate to become 10x.  

# Insyncer Traits 

Score each area out of 5. Don't move on to next questions until you've given the score for that trait.


## Technical proficiency (pre-scored)

Determined by code board. 

```
1 - lots of mistakes
3 - everything works but things could be optimized / documented better
5 - perfectly efficient solutions / well documented
```

## Determined Independence

Having an inner fire. Being able to self-learn, self-manage and follow-up. Not needing micro-management. Not getting frustrated and giving up easily. 

Attitude: _I'm going to fucking do this no matter what._

> Tell me about the biggest technical challenge you've faced. What was it? Why was it hard? How did you overcome it?


```
1 - I had to create an instagram clone.
3 - I had to create an instagram clone. It was hard because I'd never done full-stack before and the client needed it in 30 days.
5 - I had to create an instagram clone. It was hard because I'd never done full-stack before and the client needed it in 30 days. Also, people left and right were telling me I was foolish to take the project on with that time constraint. I took 3 online courses (frontend framework, backend framework, learn about databases) in a week then proceeded work on it methodically until I finally got it. Fuck the haters.
```

## Passion

Having a deep love for an area in tech, so much that he or she would pursue it in his or her free time.

Areas not related to tech are acceptable but have less weight.

Attitude: _I fucking love X. I'm going to do great things in X one day._

> Show me your favorite project. Why is it your favorite? Explain to me at a high-level how you did it.

> What are of tech are you excited about? Explain it to me at a high-level.

```
1 - I like UI design.
3 - I love UI design and how it's the first thing that customers see when they use an app. I try to practice UI design from time to time. 
5 - I love UI design. Check out all the cool shit I did! <Shows awesome personal projects> Sometimes I space out and think about the implications of a futuristic portable interface that can draw lines in the air with projected light which somehow provides haptic feedback.  
```

## Entrepreneurial skill

Having a deep-seated desire to disrupt the status quo. Insync values those with entrepreneurial skill because we need people to question the norm and innovate from within. Without that we lose our edge and die.


Attitude: _This fucking sucks. I'm going to do my own thing._

> Have you ever wanted to start your own startup? Did you? Why or why not?

```
1 - No. / Yes <crappy idea>.
3 - Yes. I haven't done it but here's my idea... <moderate startup idea, even if its been done before>
5 - Yes! In fact I tried with a couple of friends. <interesting startup idea with good fundamentals>  
```

## Character

> Be open. Be nice. Care.

Being open towards people different from you. Treating people who can't do anything for you with kindness. The core silent question: "Will you let good ideas win?"

Attitude: _I have strong beliefs yet I'm open to new data that could prove me wrong. I accept that others are different and that's OK. I would still fight to protect them._

> Tell me of a strong belief you hold. How do you treat others who don't believe in the same way? Are you open to be proven wrong? 


```
1 - I am an atheist and think anyone who believes in God is stupid af.
3 - I am an atheist but I believe everyone should be allowed the freedom to believe in whatever they want to. 
5 - I am an atheist but I believe everyone should be allowed the freedom to believe in whatever they want to. People believe different things for different reasons and perhaps if I were in their situation, I would believe as they do. 
```

## X factor

> The big surprise to me was that the intuitive judgment that the interviewers summoned up in the “close your eyes” exercise also did very well, indeed just as well as the sum of the six specific ratings. [...] Intuition adds value even in the justly derided selection interview, but only after a disciplined collection of objective information and disciplined scoring of separate traits. - Thinking Fast and Slow p. 231

A subjective rating of the candidate and how I think he/she will fit in Insync culture. Can base on Introductory Guide Questions. 

Extra questions:
* Tell me an interesting fact many people don't know.
* Tell me a joke.
* What are things that are very offensive to you?

# Closing

* Any questions?
* When can you start?

# Evaluation

We're going for >= 75%

> The surprising success of equal-weighting schemes has an important practical implication: it is possible to develop useful algorithms without any prior statistical research. Simple equally weighted formulas based on existing statistics or on common sense are often very good predictors of significant outcomes.

Intuitions Vs. Formulas > Page 232
> First, select a few traits that are prerequisites for success in this position (technical proficiency, engaging personality, reliability, and so on). Don’t overdo it—six dimensions is a good number. The traits you choose should be as independent as possible from each other, and you should feel that you can assess them reliably by asking a few factual questions. Next, make a list of those questions for each trait and think about how you will score it, say on a 1–5 scale. You should have an idea of what you will call “very weak”or “very strong.”

Intuitions Vs. Formulas > Page 232
> To avoid halo effects, you must collect the information on one trait at a time, scoring each before you move on to the next one. Do not skip around. To evaluate each candidate, add up the six scores. Because you are in charge of the final decision, you should not do a “close your eyes.” Firmly resolve that you will hire the candidate whose final score is the highest, even if there is another one whom you like better— try to resist your wish to invent broken legs to change the ranking.
