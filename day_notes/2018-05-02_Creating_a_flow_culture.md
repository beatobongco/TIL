## Creating a Flow Culture

**Flow** is a state of optimal experience that leads to extremely engaged and happy individuals.  We want Insyncers to benefit from a culture and environment that  promotes flow. We strive for Insyncers to become `autotelic` or to enjoy work for its own sake. 

There is no "work-life balance". It is an outdated concept. At Insync, work respects life and life respects work and the two have a [mutualistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutualism_(biology)) relationship. 

We believe work should not prevent someone from living their best life, in fact it should enable it. One should find joy in doing good work as work is a reflection of the self. Work should not make unreasonable demands and require one to miss out on big life events and experiences.

Insync is like a family so we can apply to it the five characteristics of what Csikszentmihalyi describes as "the family context that promotes flow".

What follows are thoughts on how to build an environment and culture based on this context and questions we can ask to ascertain whether an Insyncer feels his role or workplace promotes flow or whether a process is violating the flow culture. 


### 5 Characteristics / the 5 C's

#### Clarity

Insyncers know what is expected of them. Goals and feedback are unambiguous.

How to build clarity:

* onboarding should provide clear definition of an Insyncer's role and their scope of responsibility.
* heads and mentors should provide constant feedback of how an Insyncer is doing. It should never come as a surprise that someone is under-performing. Conversely, if an Insyncer is performing well a `kudos` is in order.

Question to ask:

> Is your role *clear* to you? Do you know how to succeed in it?

#### Centering

Insyncers know how what they are doing in the present impacts the company. 

* when hiring, great care must be taken in defining what we are hiring for. We must know what impact the new hire will have and be able to properly communicate this impact to them
* Insyncers should strive to know how they fit into the big picture
* the company or team should acknowledge the importance of each person/role and never belittle any role or department

Question to ask:

> Do you know how you fit into the big picture? Are you aware of *how* your work impacts the company? 

#### Choice

Insyncers know that they have the freedom to do what they want as long as they are prepared to face the (very fair but firm) consequences. 

* Insync should have minimal red tape
* Insyncers are encouraged to `default to action` rather than waiting for permission
* Insyncers are encouraged to choose and develop their own roles as long as they have measurable impact on the company
* Sometimes we have to do tasks that we don't want to do so the company can flourish but we should strive to allow everyone to do work they enjoy

Questions to ask:

> Do you enjoy your work? What role would you like to take on?

> Do you feel you are free to perform your job to the best of your ability?

#### Commitment

> Be open. Be nice. Care.

Insyncers know to trust Insync and Insync knows to trust Insyncers.

We  feel comfortable enough to set aside the shield of our defenses, and become unselfconsciously involved in our work.

A hallmark of this characteristic is [psychological safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_safety). 

* we must strive to hire and retain only people of integrity. No matter how excellent a person is if he or she has no integrity or is not a nice person then that's not a culture-fit 
* as a company, we should refrain from creating any processes or performing actions that make Insyncers lose faith in Insync's own integrity e.g. much too stringent rules, telling employees how to live their lives, trying to `own` Insyncers' time

Questions to ask

> Do you feel you can be your authentic self? If not, is there anything we can do to help you feel that you can be open?

> Do you feel you can trust your fellow Insyncers?

#### Challenge

The company is dedicated to provide Insyncers with increasingly complex opportunities for action.

* heads and mentors should be mindful to make sure Insyncers are regularly challenged. This can be achieved through role changes, joining hackathons, taking on new responsibilities, taking new company-funded courses or workshops
* Head of Team Development should spearhead these initiatives
* Insyncers should be mindful to let heads and mentors know when they aren't challenged anymore

Questions to ask

> Does your current role challenge you to grow? 

### Processes that enable flow culture

* **Person-Company Fit sessions** are quarterly or biannual 1 on 1's that ask if these 5 traits are being fulfilled.
* When thinking about changing up the office environment or instituting processes, to keep these 5 characteristics in mind and be strict to not violate any of them.

> "The family context promoting optimal experience could be described as having five characteristics. The first one is *clarity*: the teenagers feel that they know what their parents expect from them—goals and feedback in the family interaction are unambiguous. The second is *centering*, or the children’s perception that their parents are interested in what they are doing in the present, in their concrete feelings and experiences, rather than being preoccupied with whether they will be getting into a good college or obtaining a well-paying job. Next is the issue of *choice*: children feel that they have a variety of possibilities from which to choose, including that of breaking parental rules—as long as they are prepared to face the consequences. The fourth differentiating characteristic is *commitment*, or the trust that allows the child to feel comfortable enough to set aside the shield of his defenses, and become unselfconsciously involved in whatever he is interested in. And finally there is *challenge*, or the parents’ dedication to provide increasingly complex opportunities for action to their children."
