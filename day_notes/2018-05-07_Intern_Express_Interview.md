# Intern Express Interview 

My interviews have been taking too long so I've decided to do an abbreviated version for interns. This should only take 30 minutes.

If you're an interviewee and you're reading this, that's an awesome sign of your resourcefulness. You may use these questions to your benefit however be honest and let me know you've seen this beforehand. 

Before starting the process, make sure the code board for interviewee has already been scored.

## Introduction

### Expectation setting

1. Why do you want to intern here?
2. Do you know what Insync currently does?
3. Explain vision. How does it make you feel?
4. Explain culture
	* be open, be nice, care 
	* psychological safety
	* good (data-driven if available) ideas always win

# Insyncer Traits 

Score each area out of 5. Don't move on to next questions until you've given the score for that trait.

## Technical proficiency (pre-scored)

Determined by code board. 

```
1 - lots of mistakes
3 - everything works but things could be optimized / documented better
5 - perfectly efficient solutions / well documented
```

Answer:

Score: /5

## Determined Independence

Having an inner fire. Being able to self-learn, self-manage and follow-up. Not needing micro-management. Not getting frustrated and giving up easily. 

Attitude: _I'm going to fucking do this no matter what._

> Tell me about the biggest technical challenge you've faced. What was it? Why was it hard? How did you overcome it?


```
1 - I had to create an instagram clone.
3 - I had to create an instagram clone. It was hard because I'd never done full-stack before and the client needed it in 30 days.
5 - I had to create an instagram clone. It was hard because I'd never done full-stack before and the client needed it in 30 days. Also, people left and right were telling me I was foolish to take the project on with that time constraint. I took 3 online courses (frontend framework, backend framework, learn about databases) in a week then proceeded work on it methodically until I finally got it. Fuck the haters.

Score: /5

## Passion

Having a deep love for an area in tech, so much that he or she would pursue it in his or her free time.

Areas not related to tech are acceptable but have less weight.

Attitude: _I fucking love X. I'm going to do great things in X one day._

> Show me your favorite project. Why is it your favorite? Explain to me at a high-level how you did it.

> What parts of tech are you excited about? Explain it to me at a high-level.

```
1 - I like UI design.
3 - I love UI design and how it's the first thing that customers see when they use an app. I try to practice UI design from time to time. 
5 - I love UI design. Check out all the cool shit I did! <Shows awesome personal projects> Sometimes I space out and think about the implications of a futuristic portable interface that can draw lines in the air with projected light which somehow provides haptic feedback.  
```

Answer:

Score: /5

## Entrepreneurial skill

Having a deep-seated desire to disrupt the status quo. Insync values those with entrepreneurial skill because we need people to question the norm and innovate from within. Without that we lose our edge and die.


Attitude: _This fucking sucks. I'm going to do my own thing._

> Have you ever wanted to start your own startup? Did you? Why or why not?

```
1 - No. / Yes <crappy idea>.
3 - Yes. I haven't done it but here's my idea... <moderate startup idea, even if its been done before>
5 - Yes! In fact I tried with a couple of friends. <interesting startup idea with good fundamentals>  
```

Answer:

Score: /5

## Character

> Be open. Be nice. Care.

Being open towards people different from you. Treating people who can't do anything for you with kindness. The core silent question: "Will you let good ideas win?"

Attitude: _I have strong beliefs yet I'm open to new data that could prove me wrong. I accept that others are different and that's OK. I would still fight to protect them._

> Tell me of a strong belief you hold. How do you treat others who don't believe in the same way? Are you open to be proven wrong? 


```
1 - I am an atheist and think anyone who believes in God is stupid af.
3 - I am an atheist but I believe everyone should be allowed the freedom to believe in whatever they want to. 
5 - I am an atheist but I believe everyone should be allowed the freedom to believe in whatever they want to. People believe different things for different reasons and perhaps if I were in their situation, I would believe as they do. 
```

Score: /5

## X factor

> The big surprise to me was that the intuitive judgment that the interviewers summoned up in the “close your eyes” exercise also did very well, indeed just as well as the sum of the six specific ratings. [...] Intuition adds value even in the justly derided selection interview, but only after a disciplined collection of objective information and disciplined scoring of separate traits. - Thinking Fast and Slow p. 231

A subjective rating of the candidate and how I think he/she will fit in Insync culture. Can base on Introductory Guide Questions. 

Extra questions:
* Tell me an interesting fact many people don't know.
* Tell me a joke.
* What are things that are very offensive to you?

Answer:

Score: /5

# Closing

* Any questions?
* When can you start?

# Evaluation

We're going for >= 75%
