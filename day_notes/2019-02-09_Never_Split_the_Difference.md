## Never Split the Difference by Chris Voss

A distillation of Voss' method of negotiation.

Thesis: Seek to understand before being understood.

* Active listening and empathy are the keys to better understanding. Listening gives you more information and negotiation is all about information gathering.
* Ask calibrated questions: weapons of choice are HOW and WHAT questions
* Treat people the way they need to be treated (empathy) not the way you wish to be treated (projection)
* Negotiation can be derailed by parties not present at the table. Always ask about those people wishes and needs 

Be conscious about these facets of communication
* verbal
* paraverbal
* non-verbal

Rule of 3 - get the yes 3 times in different ways so you're sure it's not counterfeit

### Types of negotiators

name | description | time for me is... | silence for me is...
-- | -- | -- | --
Analyst | Preparation and hard data are key. Hypersensitive to reciprocity | Preparation | I am thinking
Accommodator | Sometimes cannot deliver on promises, doesn't voice objections. Talks too much. | Relationship-building | I am angry
Assertive | Cannot listen without first being understood and respected. Gives an inch takes a mile. | Money | I will talk

### Some awesome calibrated questions

* How can I help to make this better for us?
* How would you like me to proceed?
* What is it hat brought us into this situation?
* How can we solve this problem?
* What's the objective? What are we trying to accomplish here?
* How am I supposed to do that?
