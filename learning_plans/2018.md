## 2018

After an almost 6 month hiatus from AI learning, I'm back.

My goal for this year is to learn how to apply AI to fun problems and deploy these into client-side projects I can show on https://beatobongco.com/UI-Kata/

As Nassim Taleb said, most of the world's innovation came from stochastic tinkering, and that's what I propose to learn: how to tinker effectively with AI.

The projects will aim to be ones that focus on `Intelligence amplification` (IA) though in the initial stages it'll be general, mostly perhaps replicating examples or studies to dissect and learn from them.

I think first steps would be to understand what IA is about and the philosophy behind it. Then that would help me decide which current approach would move me a tiny bit forward. Should I focus on deep learning or reinforcement learning? Or is there an even newer / esoteric field I should look into? 

On the practical side, focusing on getting deep learning for now should give me a foot in the door and a grasp of the elementary concepts, at least for neural nets.

### Q3

- [ ] Complete the 7 week AI bootcamp by https://wavecomp.ai/
- [ ] Participate in and complete the capstone project

### Q4

There are so many signals (good courses out there) it's hard to filter, but my current candidates are the following:

- [ ] Andrew Ng's [deeplearning.ai course](https://www.deeplearning.ai/)
- [ ] [MIT 6.S191: Introduction to Deep Learning](http://introtodeeplearning.com/)
- [ ] [Fast.ai course](http://www.fast.ai/)
- [ ] [Neural Networks for Machine Learning - Geoff Hinton](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks)

I'll aim to finish 2.

### Readings

- [ ] Godel, Escher, Bach by Douglas Hofstadter
- [ ] Papers on `Intelligence amplification`, specifically read Douglas Engelbart's [*Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework*](https://www.dougengelbart.org/pubs/augment-3906.html)
- [ ] Try reading Artifical Intelligence, A Modern Approach by Russel and Norvig
- [ ] [Reinforcement Learning by Richard Sutton](https://www.amazon.com/Reinforcement-Learning-Introduction-Adaptive-Computation-ebook/dp/B008H5Q8VA)

### Misc

- [ ] Go through https://www.tensorflow.org/dev-summit/

### Stack

As I enjoy creating UI very much, it only follows that I use the tensorflow ecosystem

* keras for high-level stuff
* tensorflow if I want to tinker a bit lower level
* tensroflow.js for the browser

As such, I'll have a bias towards talks and lessons that utilize this stack.
