## 2018

After an almost 6 month hiatus from AI learning, I'm back.

My goal for this year is to learn how to apply AI to fun problems and deploy these into client-side projects I can show on https://beatobongco.com/UI-Kata/

As Nassim Taleb said, most of the world's innovation came from stochastic tinkering, and that's what I propose to learn: how to tinker effectively with AI.

The projects will aim to be ones that focus on `Intelligence amplification` though in the initial stages it'll be general, mostly perhaps replicating examples or studies to dissect and learn from them.

### Q3

- [ ] Complete the 7 week AI bootcamp by https://wavecomp.ai/
- [ ] Participate in and complete the capstone project

### Q4

There are so many signals (good courses out there) it's hard to filter, but my current candidates are the following:

- [ ] Andrew Ng's [deeplearning.ai course](https://www.deeplearning.ai/)
- [ ] [MIT 6.S191: Introduction to Deep Learning](http://introtodeeplearning.com/)
- [ ] [Fast.ai course](http://www.fast.ai/)

I'll aim to finish 2.

### Readings

- [ ] Godel, Escher, Bach by Douglas Hofstadter
- [ ] Papers on `Intelligence amplification`, specifically read Douglas Engelbart's *Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework*
- [ ] Try reading Artifical Intelligence, A Modern Approach by Russel and Norvig

### Stack

As I enjoy creating UI very much, it only follows that I use the tensorflow ecosystem

* keras for high-level stuff
* tensorflow if I want to tinker a bit lower level
* tensroflow.js for the browser

As such, I'll have a bias towards talks and lessons that utilize this stack.
